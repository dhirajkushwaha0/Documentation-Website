            <p>JavaScript is an open-source programming language designed for creating web-centric applications. It is lightweight and interpreted which makes it much faster than other languages and is integrated with HTML making it easier to implement in web applications.

                In this Introduction to JavaScript article, you will learn all about JavaScript, the backbone of web development, and understand what exactly this language is and why and how this language is used across various fields.
                
                JavaScript is critical for web development, and if you’ve ever thought about choosing that career path, you’d surely have come across this language. And probably, that’s why you are here in the first place.</p>

        <section id="Why JavaScript">
            <h1>Why JavaScript</h1>
            <p>
                JavaScript is an essential programming language, almost compulsory to learn for students or software developers that are gravitated towards web development. Wondering why? Here’s the answer:

Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a default choice for web development. There are many frameworks available which you can use to create web applications once you have learned JavaScript.
JavaScript offers lots of flexibility. You can create stunning and fast web applications with tons of customizations to provide users with the most relevant graphical user interface.
JavaScript is now also used in mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This opens many possibilities for you as a Javascript developer.
Due to the high demand in the industry, there are tons of job growth opportunities and high pay for those who know JavaScript.
The incredible thing about Javascript is that you can find tons of frameworks and libraries already developed, which can be used directly in web development. That reduces the development time and enhances the graphical user interface.

        <section id="Java V/S JavaScript">
            <h1>Java V/S JavaScript</h1>
            <p>In the world of software development, there are two fundamental threads that bind the world of programming together: Java and JavaScript. Java and JavaScript have been around for a very long time and are still very popular today. Coders are bound to come across these terms even if they only take an occasional interest in the field. The Java programming language is used for making applications for devices or browsers, while JavaScript is used for creating HTML documents and browsers. The two can, however, be easily confused as well. There are some people out there who might think Java is just a more compact version of JavaScript, but this is not entirely accurate. Although there is some overlap between Java and JavaScript, both languages have significantly different functionality. The purpose of this article is to unravel what Java and JavaScript are as well as the difference between Java and JavaScript.Java is a cross-platform, class-based, general-purpose programming language used to build different and complex applications like web applications, mobile applications, big data technologies, etc. It incorporates object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, etc., to make the language secure and reliable. 

                It is a computing platform that consolidates a compiler, execution engine, computer software, set of libraries, and so much more for developing, running Java Applications and programs.Javascript gives life and action to dull and static pages. It becomes one of the fundamental front-end languages including HTML (HyperText Markup Language, used for creating the layout of the web page) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets, used to give style to the HTML layout like color, background, font, etc. )

                JavaScript, however, now with a recent introduction to Node.JavaScript (a platform for running JavaScript codes outside the browser) programmers can use it for server-side or backend development as well. It enhances the usability of the language and highlights its versatility.

        <section id="Advantages And Disadvantages">
            <h1>Advantages And Disadvantages</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language. Many of these are related to the way, JavaScript is often executed directly in a client’s browser commonly utilized in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a way to feature dynamic and interactive elements to websites. JavaScript is influenced by Java with the similar syntax of C. JavaScript conforms to the ECMAScript specifications which were developed by Sun Microsystems.

                JavaScript may be a client-side scripting language, which suggests the ASCII text file is processed by the client’s browser instead of on the online server. This can load the webpage without communicating with the main server by the help of JavaScript. For example, a JavaScript function may check an internet form before it’s submitted to make sure all the specified fields are filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is really transmitted to the server.
                
                Like server-side scripting languages, like PHP and ASP, JavaScript code are often inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. The output of the server-side is displayed in the HTML but the JavaScript code remains visible in the source of the webpage. The file can be a separate “.js” file, which can be displayed in the browser.
                
                JavaScript has some advantages and disadvantages. JavaScript is often executed directly on a client’s browser. JavaScript can also have the same benefits as server-side languages.</p>

        <section id="Conclusion">
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is used in various fields from the web to servers, and here’s a quick list of the significant areas it’s used in.
                Web Applications: JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and automation to websites. So, if you want your web application to be anything more than just a static page of contents, you’ll probably need to do some “JavaScript’ing.”
Mobile Applications: JavaScript isn’t just for developing web applications; it is also used for developing applications for phones and tablets. With frameworks like React Native, you can develop full-fledged mobile applications with all those fancy animations.
Web-based Games: If you’ve ever played a game directly on the web browser, JavaScript was probably used to make that happen.
Back-end Web Development: JavaScript has traditionally been used for developing the front-end parts of a web application. However, with the introduction of NodeJS, a prevalent back-end JavaScript framework, things have changed. And now, JavaScript is used for developing the back-end structure also.
